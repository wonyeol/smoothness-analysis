This file provides detailed instructions for the evaluation of the
artifact. Following the recommandations issued on the artifact
webpage, it is divided into four sections:

   1. Paper claims
   2. Basic testing
   3. Evaluation instructions
   4. Additional description


==============================================================================
1. Paper claims
==============================================================================
The paper makes both theoretical claims and practical claims.

The former (mainly Theorem 4.2, Theorem 4.4, Theorem 5.6, Theorem 5.9, and
Theorem 6.2) were proved on paper and proofs will be included in the
appendix of a long version. Thus, they are not the object of this artifact.

The latter are based on the evaluation of the PyPPAI (Python Probabilistic
Programs Abstract Interpreter, also noted Pyppai) static analyser on a
series of Pyro programs taken from the Pyro webpage. We have implemented
the Pyppai static analyser in OCaml and will make its source code publicly
available. The practical claims made based on the use of Pyppai focus on
two points:

 (a) The smoothness static analysis, which conservatively infers sets
     of random variables with respect to which the probability density
     of a probabilistic programs is "smooth", where smooth means either
     differentiable or locally Lipschitz-continuous (the analysis supports
     both and takes the property of interest as a parameter).

 (b) The selection of reparameterisable random variables for the optimised
     inference of a pair of probabilistic programs called a model and a
     guide.

The claims related to (a) appear in Table 3 (and Table 6 in the appendix).
The claims related to (b) appear in Table 4 (and Table 7 in the appendix).
Both of these series of claims are the object of this artifact.


==============================================================================
2. Basic testing
==============================================================================
The object of basic testing is to confirm that the Pyppai static analyser
is installed as well as all its dependences and can run normally.

To do this carry out the following operations:

1. open a terminal (using the Applications > Accessories > Byobu Terminal
   or Applications > Accessories > Mate Terminal).

2. in the terminal, run the following commands:

   cd Desktop/pyppai
   make                   # this step compiles all executables of Pyppai
   make reparl            # this step performs one instance of our analysis
                          # on all test cases (should run in a few seconds)

3. open the file "reparl.all" in the Desktop/pyppai directory with a text
editor (emacs, gvim, and vi are available and can be ran from the terminal),
go to the end of the file, and check that all test cases show "OK".


==============================================================================
3. Evaluation instructions
==============================================================================
This section is divided into four parts. The first part discusses the basic
uses of the pyppai static analyser. The second part describes the list of
test cases. The third part and the fourth part respectively focus on the
reproduction of the claims (a) and (b) (in section 1).


3.1. Running the pyppai analyser.

For the sake of simplicity, we provide a makefile that encapsulates both
the compilation and the execution of the pyppai static analyser. Thus,
all the commands in this section are based on the makefile.

The command for the compilation is based on the dune build system (it is
invoked by 'make' as seen above):

  $(DIFF-MAIN):
          dune build $(DIFF-MAIN)  && cp $(DIFF-MAIN)  diff-main.exe
  $(DIFF-BATCH):
          dune build $(DIFF-BATCH) && cp $(DIFF-BATCH) diff-batch.exe

The execution of Pyppai on each test case is based on the passing of a
number of options which are set in the makefile and in an OCaml file that
includes all the regression testing data. This file is located in:

         batch_diff/batch_diff.ml

We encourage the reader to have a look at the parameters described in this
file as we comment them more in detail below.

For each mode (smoothness analysis or reparameterisation), it is possible
to run Pyppai on each example one by one (which is preferable to produce
shorter logs, that are easier to compare with the paper claims) or to run
it on all examples in a same execution (which is best for regression testing
purpose). We explain both in the following, but stress the former as we
think it is easier to check the paper claims.


3.2. Test cases and overview of the makefile targets.

The paper studies 13 model/guide pairs from the Pyro test suite, and 1
model/guide pair from Section 2 of our paper, which are listed below,
together with their position in the list "tests_diff_all" in
batch_diff/batch_diff.ml:

  0. air model
  1. air guide
  2. br model
  3. br guide
  4. csis model
  5. csis guide
  6. dmm model
  7. dmm guide
  8. lda model
  9. lda guide
 10. sgdef model
 11. sgdef guide
 12. ssvae model
 13. ssvae guide
 14. vae model
 15. vae guide
 16. spnor model
 17. spnor guide
 18. dpmm model
 19. dpmm guide
 20. cvae model
 21. cvae guide
 22. scanvi model
 23. scanvi guide
 24. prodlda model
 25. prodlda guide
 26. mhmm model
 27. mhmm guide

Furthermore, for each example, the "tests_diff_all" structure contains:

 - a link to the source code (file and entry point);
 - manually written lists of random variables and learnable parameters,
   smoothness information for each random variable or learnable parameter,
   which is used to confirm the correctness of the analyses results (we get
   back to this in the next two sub-sections).

Moreover, comments give additional explanations regarding to the reasons
why density is smooth or not with respect to certain random variables or
parameters (for which this is more difficult to see). The summary description
of all the examples is given in the paper in Table 2. The source files are
available under the Desktop/srepar directory.

For each test case 'test', the makefile contains 5 entries:

 compd.test:  compositional differentiability analysis (point (a))
 compl.test:  compositional lipschitzness analysis (point (a))
 fwdd.test:   forward differentiability analysis, not described in the paper
              (this analysis computes in a different manner results that are
              very similar to compd.test; although its description is probably
              interesting we did not do it in our paper for space reason)
 repard.test: reparameterisation with differentiability information
              (this analysis should be considered experimental)
 reparl.test: reparameterisation with lipschitzness information (point (b))

We discuss in the next two sub-section the use of these targets to confirm the
claims in the paper.

Moreover, the makefile contains the following targets to run many tests in
one command:

 compd-split:   runs all compd.test targets
 compl-split:   runs all compl.test targets
 reparl-split:  runs all reparl.test targets
 compd:         runs all compd.test in a single file  (regression testing)
 compl:         runs all compl.test in a single file  (regression testing)
 reparl:        runs all reparl.test in a single file (regression testing)

To help the reader understand the makefile targets, we list the main options
that can be observed in these:

 -comp       compositional analysis      (-no-comp to deactivate it)
 -fwd        forward analysis            (-no-fwd to deactivate it)
 -analysis   only run the analysis (no reparameterisation)
 -srepar-n   performs analysis and reparameterisation
 -g-diff     use differentiability as a target property
 -g-lipsch   use Lipschitzness as a target property
 -sel i      selects model at index i and guide at index i+1 (see above for
             the test case indexes)

As indicated in the paper, computation times are very low, so total runtimes
(even in the regression testing mode where all tests are ran in sequence)
should be of at most a few seconds.


3.3. Smoothness analysis (see above, Section 1, point (a)).

We now discuss in detail how the claims regarding to the smoothness analysis
(differentiability or lipschitzness) can be checked using the aforementioned
compd.test and compl.test targets. For this, we explain the steps performed
by the analysis, the log structure, and how the log contents establishes the
claims of the paper.

In this subsections, we are looking at the compd.x and compl.x targets, with
flags -analysis (only analysis), -comp, -no-fwd (compositional smoothness
analysis ON, forward smoothness analysis --that is not described in the paper--
OFF) and either -g-diff or -g-lipsch (depending on the property that is
considered).

In this case one analysis run proceeds as follows:

 1. parsing of the python source
 2. forward pre-analysis to determine safety properties (numerical invariants
    that make it possible to check whether each operation in the program may
    cause an error, possibly yielding non smoothness); this phase is referred
    to as "initial forward analysis"
 3. compositional analysis for smoothness (differentiability or lipschitzness
    depending on the parameter), using information 

Moreover, each test case corresponds to two analyses: one for the model, and
then the other for the guide.

We now show a log structure. As an example, we consider compd.air (example
air, differentiability analysis) and elide long programs or invariant dumps
with [...explanation...]. First, we look into the analysis of the model:

   ===========================================================================
   Analysing for differentiability "../srepar/srepar/examples/air/model.py"
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Program:
     [...program abstract syntax tree...]
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Analysis starts(forward,num:(signs) X (Apron<nd_PA_box>))
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Analysis log...
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Analysis output(forward,num:(signs) X (Apron<nd_PA_box>)): (no div0,pars:?)
     [...output during the initial forward analysis...]
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Output of initial forward analysis:
     [...information computed by the initial forward analysis: parameters
         found; numerical information; safety;...]
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Analysis starts(forward+relational,num:top domain)
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Analysis log...
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Analysis output(forward+relational,num:top domain): (no div0,pars:?)
     [...compositional smoothness analysis results...]
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   RESULT FOR ../srepar/srepar/examples/air/model.py:
   oracle:	{ decode_l2; }
   result:	{ decode_l2; }
   ===========================================================================

The last three lines describe:

 - the oracle result (smoothness information collected by hand for the sake
   of regression testing, as shown in batch_diff/batch_diff.ml);
 - the smoothness information computed by the analysis.

The two values should match when the analysis computes the expected
information. The log continues with a similar section related to the analysis
of the guide. Finally, the final part of the log describes the status of the
testing and produce the numbers shown in the paper. In the case of compd.air,
we get:

   ===========================================================================
   REGRESSION TEST RESULTS:
   ===========================================================================
   Total:   2
   OK:      2
   KO:      0
   Crash:   0
   Unknown: 2
   Failed cases:
   ===========================================================================
   Detailed results:
   ===========================================================================
   air guide              OK    0.0769 s  rvar(cont+disc)+param: [3 smooth, 14 may nonsmooth] (may nonsmooth={ bl_c_init; bl_h_init; bl_predic
   air model              OK    0.1007 s  rvar(cont+disc)+param: [1 smooth, 4 may nonsmooth] (may nonsmooth={ decode_l1; z_pres_{}; z_what_{};
   ===========================================================================
   Batch testing finished!

This means that the model has 1 differentiable continuous random variable
and the guide has 3. Note that the numbers include only the continuous
random variables (discrete random variables are obviously not smooth).

Most importantly, you can reproduce each column of Table 3 (and 6) mainly by
running `make compd` and `make compl`:

  - The columns `Manual` are obtained by inspecting the oracle results
    (i.e., expected smoothness results) recorded in batch_diff/batch_diff.ml.
  - The columns `Ours` and `Time` are obtained from the outputs of compd and
    compl, especially from (# smooth rvar+param): e.g., 3 for air-guide from
    compd.air explained above.
  - The column `#CRP` is obtained by computing (# smooth rvar+param) + (# may
    nonsmooth rvar+param) - (# discrete rvar), where the first two values are
    obtained from the output of compd and compl and the third value is
    obtained by inspecting the actual python codes (in Desktop/srepar).
    
For your reference, we attach below the number and names of discrete random
variables in each example:

  example         number (name) of discrete random variables

  air guide       1 (z_pres_{})

  vae model       0


3.4. Selective reparameterisation analysis (see above, Section 1, point (b)).

The selective reparameterisation involves several smoothness analysis
phases, thus we recommend consider the evaluation of the smoothness analysis
(in the previous subsection) before the following steps.

In this subsections, we are looking at the reparl.x target, with flags
-srepar-n (analysis + selective reparameterisation) and -g-lipsch.

To perform selective reparameterisation, pyppai performs the following
steps:

 1. parsing of the python sources of both model and guide and smoothness
    analysis as explained before
 2. determination of the random variables that satisfy the reparameterisation
    condition in the guide
 3. production of a reparameterised guide (according to the random variables
    selected in step 2).
 4. analysis of the resulting guide
 5. checking that the reparameterisation correctness condition is satisfied

Remark: if the condition 5 is not satisfied, a new, smaller set of variables
should be used for reparameterisation (according to Section 6 in our paper),
and the steps 3-5 should in theory be done again; however, this does not
happen in any of the examples encountered so far (as mentioned in the last
paragraph of Section 6 in our paper).

Therefore, the reparl.x file have the following layout (we consider air as
an example again):

   [...analysis of the model...]
   [...analysis of the guide...]
   ===========================================================================
   REPARAMETERISATION CONDITIONS:
   ===========================================================================
   [...a few lines showing the conditions to evaluate the candidate
       set of variables that can be safely reparameterised...]
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Sets of reparameterised variables
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Repar set: [...set of variables that can be reparameterised...]
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Reparameterised model:
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   [...source code of the reparameterised model...]
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Reparameterised guide:
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   [...source code of the reparameterised guide...]
   ===========================================================================
   [...analysis of the reparameterised model...]
   [...analysis of the reparameterised guide...]
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   TIME,../srepar/srepar/examples/air/model.py,model: 0.0206 s
   TIME,../srepar/srepar/examples/air/guide.py,guide: 0.1209 s
   ===========================================================================
   REGRESSION TEST RESULTS:
   ===========================================================================
   air guide              OK    0.2239 s  rvar(cont+disc): [1 repar, 3 all] (all={ z_pres_{}; z_what_{}; z_where_{}; })
   ===========================================================================
   Batch testing finished!

The last line, especially `... OK ... [1 repar, 3 all] ...`, states that our
analysis (in step 2) found 1 random variable to be reparameterisable among
3 continuous/discrete random variables, and it successfully checked the
correctness condition (in step 5) for the reparameterisation of the chosen
1 random variable.

Most importantly, you can reproduce each column of Table 4 (and 7) mainly by
running `make reparl`:

  - The column `Ours` is obtained from the output of reparl, especially
    from (# repar rvar): e.g., 1 for air from reparl.air explained above.
  - The column `#DR` is obtained from the list of discrete random variables
    (shown in the previous subsection). We found two typos on this column
    (air: 2-->1, lda: 2-->1); we will fix them in our paper.
  - The column `#CR` is obtained by computing (# all rvar) - (# discrete
    rvar), where the first value is obtained from the output of reparl and
    the second value from the column `#DR`.
  - The column `Pyro \ Ours` is obtained by manually inspecting the oracle
    smoothness results recorded in batch_diff/batch_diff.ml.


==============================================================================
4. Additional description
==============================================================================

In this section, we provide some additional information about advanced use
of pyppai to either analyse other programs or to better understand and check
the analysis process.

4.1. Code structure

The Pyppai source code includes several analyses, including a previously
published support analysis. Therefore, we only list here the files that
are connected with the smoothness analysis and reparameterisation.
We are interested in the following directory:

 - lib:
   general utilities and primitives to interact with the Apron numerical
   abstract domain library
 - pyir:
   frontend components, which are based on the pyml and pyast libraries
 - ai_diff:
   core of the implementation of the smoothness analysis
 - batch_diff:
   entry point of the batch testing of the smoothness analysis and of the
   selective reparameterisation
 - entry_diff:
   standalone smoothness analysis (for convenience we recommend all tests
   be done with the batch testing though).

We detail the content of ai_diff and batch_diff directories (we omit the
"dune" files which control the build system):

  ai_diff/ai_diff.{ml,mli}
     analysis abstract interpreter (main analysis engine)
  ai_diff/ddom_diff.{ml,mli}
     implementation of the modules for all the smoothness abstract domains used
     in the smoothness analysis
  ai_diff/ddom_sig.ml
     main type definitions
  ai_diff/diff_util.{ml,mli}
     general utilities for the differentiability/lipschitzness analysis
  ai_diff/dom_util.{ml,mli}
     abstract domain utilities
  ai_diff/ddom_num.{ml,mli}
     implementation of the modules for the numerical abstarct domains
  ai_diff/reparam.ml
     program transformation for the reparameterisation
  batch_diff/batch_diff.ml
     entry point of the analysis with regression testing.
  

4.2. Generation of detailed analysis logs

It is possible to turn on many flags in order to get verbose description
of the analysis steps. This is useful in order to understand the analysis
intermediate results, but turning on many of these flags quickly make logs
very long. The flags are located in ai_diff/diff_util.ml. The main flags
are listed below with the description of the kind of information they
lead to dump:

 dbg_apron     numerical abstract domain
 dbg_init      smoothness abstract domain initialisation
 dbg_join      smoothness abstract domain join
 dbg_compose   smoothness abstract domain compose operation
 dbg_call      smoothness abstract domain function calls analysis
 dbg_param     analysis of the parameter definitions
 dbg_module    analysis of the modules definitions
 dbg_sample    analysis of the "sample" probabilistic programming operation
 dbg_observe   analysis of the "observe" probabilistic programming operation
 dbg_loop      analysis of loops

After any modification, just type "make" in the pyppai directory to rebuild
all the executables with the desired level of verbosity.

Each flag typically leads to the display of intermediate invariants. Thus,
to understand these outputs, we need to describe the abstract information
computed by the analysis. Such abstract information describe in a conservative
manner sets of functions from states to states. We recall that states are in
fact a generalisation of memory states (see paper) where "variables" are of
either of the following four forms:

   - a program variable
   - [randvar:rdb] where randvar is a random variable:
     random database entry for "randvar"
   - [randvar:prb] where randvar is a random variable:
     probability density entry for "randvar"
   - [randvar:val] where randvar is a random variable:
     sampled value for "randvar"

The general structure of an abstraction of a set of functions is as follows:

   Mods: [...set of modified variables...]
   Deps: (only non x -> {x} cases)
      [...list of dependence sets of the form var => { var set }...]
   May non-smooth: (only non empty cases)
      [...list of possibly non smooth sets of the form var => { var set }...]

Note that trivial dependences (x => would mean that x depends just on itself)
and smoothness information (x => { } would mean that x is smooth with respect
to all program variables) are ommitted for the sake of concision (logs do get
large).


4.3. Process to create additional test cases.

We now list the steps to analyse additional test cases.

The simpler way to do it is to add entries in the batch_diff/batch_diff.ml
file, to recompile pyppai, and then to add new makefile targets, in a similar
way as for the existing tests:

- add two new entries at the end of the tests_diff_all_list of the following
  form (the first will denote the model, the second the guide):
    { rte_name       = 
      rte_filename   = 
      rte_inlinefns  = 
      rte_diffinfo   = 
      rte_rvars      = 
      rte_guide_pars = 
    }
  (it is very important that the new entries are added at the end of the list
  since the makefile selects tests using indexes)

- fill in the name (rte_name), source code destination (rte_filename), and
  the list of entry point functions (rte_inlinefs; usually a single function
  is considered);

- fill in the list of random variables and learnable parameters in the
  rte_vars and rte_guide_pars fields (each field should be a "string list")

- set the rte_diffinfo to either reflect the absence of information (None)
  or (optionally) a list of manually checked pieces of differentiability
  information (Diff for differentiable and Lips for locally Lipschitz).

The last step is only useful in regression testing mode. It is safe to just
put "None". The analysis will run and it is possible to look into the
smoothness information that it computes by hand. Note that the log will
contain a "FAIL" in that case, which just means that the regression tester
could not confirm that the analysis output is confirmed to be equal to the
manually entered output (because there is no such output...).
